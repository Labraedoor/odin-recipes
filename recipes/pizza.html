    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Past</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b><br>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b><br>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b><br>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b><br>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li><b>Step 5</b><br>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
        <li><b>Step 6</b><br>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li><b>Step 7</b><br>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
